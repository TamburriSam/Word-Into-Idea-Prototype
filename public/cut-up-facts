Word into idea is inspired by "the Cut-up technique"- an aleatory (random choice) literary technique popularized in the late 1950's by American writer William S. Burroughs.

David Bowie used cut-ups in the 1970's to help construct his lyrics 

Thom Yorke, lead singer of the rock band Radiohead, borrowed elements from the technique- writing single lyric lines, placing them into a hat, and drawing them out randomly while the band rehearsed. 

The technique is known to aide in creative flow and writer's block relief.
